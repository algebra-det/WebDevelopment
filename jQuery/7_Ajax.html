  <h>Ajax:</h>
  <p>It can not be used locally without an internet connection like jquery</p>
  <p>It can be used just like the jquery animation in which when the user clicks,</p>
  <p>some data is sent to the server and then something happens/done without the user being </p>
  <p>redirected to another page. FOR EXAMPLE, when we compose an email and then hit send</p>
  <p>Then the data is sent to the email server , after successful completion, it displays "send"</p>
  <p>on the same page the user is in i.e. gmail</p>
  <div class="circle">This is a circle</div>

  <script type="text/javascript">

    // the "data" variable/parameter will contain the data of the info.txt file which we got through $.get()
    $.get("info.txt", function(data) {

        alert(data);

    })

    /*Think what if there is no info.txt file or the user's device catch bad internet speed
      THAN it will not load the info.txt file, hence nothing will work,
      that's where we will use $.ajax */
