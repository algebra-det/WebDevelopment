  <h1>Regualar Expressions</h1>
  <p>These are just a way to check the format or the content of a string.</p>
  <p>For example, if it has a number in it, or a data, or an email address, etc.s</p>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // we use regular expressions by /(thing_to_check)/ i.e. entering the thing to check between //
    var regex = /is/;

    var string = "Regex is great!";

    var result = string.match(regex);
    // match the string according to the regex variable
    // in other words check if the "is" is present in "Regex is great"

    alert(result);
    // if "is" is present in "regex is great!" than it will return "is" , and if it's not present
    // than it will return "null"


    // To have a Case insensetive checking, we have to define "/()/i" i.e. "i" at the end of regular expression
    // here "i" means insensetive flag
    var tocheck = /Hero/i;

    var checkin = "He is not a hErO!";

    var checked = checkin.match(tocheck)

    alert(checked)


    // To check with also knowing how many times something appeared we use "g" at the end of RE
    // here "g" means global flag
    var to = /e/g;

    var from = "He is a hero but only in dreams!";

    var final = from.match(to);

    alert(final)
