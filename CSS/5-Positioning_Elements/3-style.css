/* The fixed and relative positioning have been defined in the 4-,5-&6- of packages
Here we have defined in .parent .child-1 a relative-positioning,

for the Realtive positioning, the context for the element is the element itself.

Below try to play some with the top,left, bottom,right...You will come to see
that it will move such px from it's initial position , 
if the top is 50px than it will move 50px down from it's initial position in the document flow
Hence we can say it was positioned relative to itself/parent element

You can also move it out of it's parent class/element
try top:500px , it will move outside from it's parent element..
This can be or can be not a useful situtation in some scenarios

We can also define it like if we don't want it to be positioned outside of 
it's parent element, we can define it to be invisible or not displayed if
it is moved outside of the parent element Context
