/* Coming from 3-style.css :-
We can also define it like if we don't want it to be positioned outside of 
it's parent element, we can define it to be invisible or not displayed if
it is moved outside of the parent element Context.

TO AVOID THIS MOVING OUTSIDE OF THE PARENT CLASS BEHAVIOUR WE CAN
Simply go to the parent class (i.e. in our case .parent)
and ADD "overflow: hidden;"
So this overflow will hide the elements that moves from it's Context

This is just a behaviour you want on what depending on your project requirements

There is one issue though with this
Check this in 5-style.css
